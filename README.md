The goal of this project is to implement a **path planner** prototype for **autonomous highway driving** in the scenario provided by [Udacity's simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

The program for the path planner, written in C++, communicates with the simulator in order to generate smooth, comfortable and safe paths for the autonomous vehicle, based on localization and sensor fusion data.

The autonomous vehicle, with the help of the path planning system, safely navigates around the virtual highway (50 mph limited) with other traffic that is driving at different *arbitrary* velocities below the track limit. The car tries to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, passing slower traffic when possible, without experiencing total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 or jerk greater than 10 m/s^3. The car also avoids hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless it performs a lane change maneuver.

#### Main car's localization data (noiseless)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the planner

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor fusion data (noiseless), a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road.

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.
